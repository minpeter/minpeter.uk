# What is a template?

While using Proxmox, I encountered the concept of a _template_ for the first time.  
By creating a template, you can skip the installation process each time and clone VMs from the template instead.

To set up Kubernetes, you need both master nodes and worker nodes.  
At least three VMs are required, and during my initial attempts (actually twice...), I didn't know about templates and went through the installation process for each VM manually.  
Running the setup process for three VMs simultaneously caused network congestion and delays due to update-related traffic.  
Let's solve this by creating a template, so we can skip the installation process by cloning the template instead.

# Creating an Ubuntu 22.04 Server Template

## 1. Creating a VM

Start by creating a VM that will serve as the base for the template.  
This VM will use a lightweight cloud image, which requires slightly different settings from the usual process.

1. **Create a VM** in Proxmox.
2. Name the VM to be used as a template `ubuntu-22-04-server-template`.  
   Set the **VM ID to 900**, as the instructions assume this ID for further steps.
3. In the **Media** section, select **Do not use any media**.  
   This is because we will use a cloud image later.
4. In the **System** tab, check the box for **Qemu Agent**.  
   This allows you to monitor the VM's state while it is running. Although optional, enabling this now makes things more convenient later.
5. **Remove the disk**, set the CPU to **1 core**, and the memory to **1GB**.

6. Configure the **network** settings as you would for a regular VM.

## 2. Setting up Cloud-Init

In the VM's **Hardware** tab, click **Add > CloudInit Drive**.  
This will add a Cloud-Init drive to the VM's hard disk.  
Next, go to the **Cloud-Init** tab and configure the **User Data**.  
Ensure the network setting is configured as DHCP to avoid IP conflicts in cloned VMs.  
You don't need to specify a domain, and for the SSH Public Key, follow the steps below to generate one.

### 2.1 Generating an SSH Key

Generate an SSH key.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t <key-type> -C <comment>
```

Key types include rsa, dsa, ecdsa, and ed25519.  
The comment is a description for the key.

When prompted with `Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\minpeter/.ssh/id_rsa):`, enter an appropriate name like `proxmox_key`.  
When asked `Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):`, you can choose to set a password or leave it blank (the latter is recommended).

Copy the generated public key.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/<key-name>.pub
```

For example, if you named it `proxmox_key`, use `cat ~/.ssh/proxmox_key.pub`.

## 3. Downloading the Cloud Image

Some steps need to be performed in the PVE shell for further configuration.

### 3.1 Accessing the PVE Shell

Access the shell via the web GUI or by running `ssh root@<proxmox server ip>`.

### 3.2 Downloading the Cloud Image

You can download the image from [this link](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/minimal/releases/jammy/release/).  
Use `wget` to download the `ubuntu-22.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img` file.

```bash
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/minimal/releases/jammy/release/ubuntu-22.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img
```

Next, run the command:

```bash
qm set 900 -serial0 socket -vga serial0
```

Here, `900` is the VM ID.

### 3.3 Converting the Cloud Image

Convert the image.

```bash
mv ubuntu-22.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img ubuntu-22.04.qcow2
qemu-img resize ubuntu-22.04.qcow2 32G
```

### 3.4 Adding the Cloud Image

Add the image to the VM.

```bash
qm importdisk 900 ubuntu-22.04.qcow2 local-lvm
```

Again, `900` refers to the VM ID.

### 3.5 Configuring the Cloud Image

After completing these steps, you'll notice an **Unused Disk 0** in the VM's **Hardware** tab in the web GUI.  
Click **Edit**, check the **Discard** option, and then click **Apply**.

Go to the **Options** tab, set the **Boot Order** to the second position, and change **Start at boot** to **Yes**.

With all configurations complete, right-click the VM (`900`, `ubuntu-22-04-server-template`) in the VM list and select **Convert to Template**.  
After a brief process, the template will be created.

## 4. Creating a VM from the Template

Now, let's create a VM using the newly created template.

Right-click the template, and you'll notice the menu has changed.  
Click **Clone**.

In the **Clone VM** window, change the **Name** to `ubuntu-test` and set the **Mode** to **Full Clone**.  
Click **Clone**, power on the VM, and wait. That's it!

# In the Next Post...

We'll use this template to create `k8s-ctrlr` and `k8s-node`, add an additional `k8s-node` template, and configure a setup with one `k8s-ctrlr` and two `k8s-nodes`.
